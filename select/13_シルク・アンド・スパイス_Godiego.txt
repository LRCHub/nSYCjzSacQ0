Once there was an empire
At its peak of
Glory and fame
Once there was invasion
And things were
Never the same
Once the famous
Genghis 'Khan
And horsemen
Galloped past
And even now the sheep
As caravan cities pass
Once the domes of
Splendor Minarets of
Turquoise and yellow
The mystic gardens
Of Persia Where
People used to go
But still
The road remains
Smelling of the ages
Pouring out the sounds
And shadow of
Fate imerges
Once and if and only if
The tricky hand of fate
Myth and fact, create
The stories that
Sing and cry
Of the road of
Silk and spice
